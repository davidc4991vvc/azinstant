azinstant
=========

A site that shows movie search results from Amazon as you type in an instant manner.  
This was done on a hack day and there are many edgy parts and duct tapes holding it together!

Azinstant makes use of the following:   

Flask - REST API   
Amazon Product API - Catalog Data   
Amazon Simple Product API - Wrapper    

jQuery - AJAX and JSONP                
Twitter Bootstrap   
Bootswatch - theme
